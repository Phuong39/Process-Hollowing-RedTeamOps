# Process-Hollowing-RedTeamOps
Red Team Operation's Defense Evasion Technique for executing without  raising flags on Target System.

We have both x86 and x64 bit release as you want. **we strongly suggest x64-but release if you're bit confused about compiling manually**
We suggest to use directly compiled executables as in some situations it depends on your compiler.


**If you wish to Compile x64 bit relese on Kali with cross-compiler - x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc** 
**For 32-bit - Mingw for Windows**
